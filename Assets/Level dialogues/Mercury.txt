Hello this is Earth speaking.
You are entering Mercurys orbit. 
Mercury is planet that is closest to the Sun. So be aware of the heat. 
You will feel that gravity is much weaker than gravity on Earth, but that shouldn't be a problem. 
Also, very helpful, Mercury has no atmosphere at all, so meteors can be an issue.
Collect that element and come home safe. Good luck commander.
