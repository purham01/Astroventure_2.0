Hello, this is Earth speaking!
You are approaching Jupiter.
Jupiter is the biggest planet in Solar System.
It is 5th planet from the Sun and it has the fastest rotation.
Jupiter has very strong gravity, almost 3 times stronger than Earth.
There is also biggest temperature difference between sufrace and core.
Because of that scientists are guessing that Jupiter is a failed star.
Nevertheless, Jupiters Magnetic field is strong protector against ASteroids that go towards the Earth.
Stay safe, and good luck.
