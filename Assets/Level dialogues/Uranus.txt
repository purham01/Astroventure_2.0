From what we know of Uranus, it seems it was hit by a titanic collision millions of years ago.
It caused it to rotate around it's axis at a jaw dropping 97.7 degree angle. 
Comparatively, Earth only rotates around it's axis around a 23.5-degree angle, meaning Uranus spins almost completely sideways. 
We believe this collision might have left traces on the planet of whatever it was that hit it.
Your goal is to collect it. 
We don't know where this object came from, what it is or how it will interact with other elements of our Solar system. 
So be prepared for anything. 
Also...
Remember that the average temperature of Uranus is -195Â°C, being the coldest planet in our solar system.
So make sure to drink some tea.
