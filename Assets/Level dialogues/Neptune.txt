Neptune is quite an oddity in our solar system. 
Despite being the planet furthest from the sun, it's temperature is higher than on Uranus. 
Alongside that, it has winds that go up to 2500 KM/h, the strongest in our solar system. 
Now this wouldn't be so strange...
If it wasn't the planet furthest from the Sun, since our winds are caused by the Sun's energy.
We believe these stange things happening on the planet could be caused by some...

We have also noticed strange storms appearing every few years on various parts of Neptune. 
We first noticed it in 1989. naming it "The Great Dark Spot". 
Now it has appeared again. 
We want you to go into the storm and find out what's at the center.
Our readings show a crystal cave, moving with the storm. 
We believe it could have been created by Neptune's unique atmosphere, which has been shown to be able to forge diamonds.
And we believe it could also contain the cause of all this.
