Saturn's most notable feature are certainly it's rings.
These rings are divided into sections, and our target element lies in a notable gap between rings A and B...
...the Cassini Division.
Unfortunately, the rings are comprised mostly of dust, so we will have to land you on a moonlet embedded near the edge of the B ring.
Though Saturn's gravity is similar to Earth's on the surface,...
...the gravity near the Cassini Division is more akin to Mars or Mercury.
You will use this fact to scale the B ring and reach the Division.
But be careful! The particles are made almost entirely of ice...
...and there are no stable spaces for checkpoints, so there could be a long fall back to the moonlet!
